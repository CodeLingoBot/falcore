// Request wrapper
// 
// The request is wrapped so that useful information can be kept 
// with the request as it moves through the pipeline.  
//
// A pointer is kept to the originating Connection.
//
// There is a unique ID assigned to each request.  This ID is not 
// globally unique to keep it shorter for logging purposes.  It is 
// possible to have duplicates though very unlikely over the period 
// of a day or so.  It is a good idea to log the ID in any custom
// log statements so that individual requests can easily be grepped
// from busy log files.
//
// Falcore collects performance statistics on every stage of the 
// pipeline.  The stats for the request are kept in PipelineStageStats.
// This structure will only be complete in the Request passed to the
// pipeline RequestDoneCallback.  Overhead will only be available in
// the RequestDoneCallback and it's the difference between the total
// request time and the sums of the stage times.  It will include things
// like pipeline iteration and the stat collection itself.
// 
// See falcore.PipelineStageStat docs for more info.
// 
// The Signature is also a cool feature. See the
